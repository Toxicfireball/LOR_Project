# A Website Based on our personal system that combines both 5E and PF2E mechanics

## NOTABLE CHANGES INCLUDE
- The proficiency of PF2E and 5E semi-combined
- Paladin over Champion as a class
- Summoner is now a Warlock subclass
- Skill-based initiative system based on roleplay
- Two types of AC : Dodge and Armour. One avoids damage entirely while the other mitigates it.
